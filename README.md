# Smart-Finance-App
🎉 Journey of Building My Smart Finance App with GenAI
Hello everyone! 🌟 I've embarked on an incredible journey of creating a personal finance app, and I wanted to share my experience with you.

For the longest time, I had the dream of building an application to manage my finance efficiently. However, my vision was often shrouded by the lack of knowledge on the resources available that could execute this task optimally and at zero cost.

Thanks to GenAI, this dream has finally become a reality! Initially, I anticipated that even with the help of GenAI, it might take a week just to build the initial version. To my delightful surprise, it only took a day to craft both the UI and the backend—complete with a file upload feature! ⚡
